// Dynamic Typing - you don't tell the engine what type of data the var holds
//  => it's figured out during execution
//  => can hold different types depending on what is being executed

// Primitive Type - a type of data that represents a single value (not an object)
// 1. undefined - lack of existence/ never set (what JS engine sets vars to initially)
// 2. null - lack of existence (used when you want to set var to nothing)
// 3. boolean - true or false
// 4. number - floating point (ie decimals) is the only type in JS
// 5. string - sequence of chars with '' or ""
// 6. symbol - used in ES6


// 19 //

// Operators - a special function that is sytactically different
//  => Generally, they take two parameters and return one result

var a = 3 + 4;   // the addition operator (function) is called with infix notation
console.log(a);
